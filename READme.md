# LOGOmaker

This command-line application generates a simple logo in SVG format based on user input for text, color, and shape. The generated logo is saved as an SVG file named logo.svg.

## User Story
As a freelance web developer, I want to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I don't have to pay a graphic designer.

### Acceptance Criteria
The application should meet the following acceptance criteria:

Prompt the user for up to three characters for the text in the logo.
Prompt the user for a color keyword or a hexadecimal number for the text color.
Present the user with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.
Prompt the user for a color keyword or a hexadecimal number for the selected shape.
Create an SVG file named logo.svg with the generated logo.
Print the message "Generated logo.svg" in the command line after the file is saved.
Display a 300x200 pixel image that matches the user's input when the logo.svg file is opened in a browser.
